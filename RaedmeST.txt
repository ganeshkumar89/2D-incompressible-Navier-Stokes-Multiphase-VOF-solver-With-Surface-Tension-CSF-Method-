# CGflow Incompressible Navier-Stokes Multiphase VOF Solver with Surface Tension (Toy Code)

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) toy code for incompressible two-phase flows with surface tension effects using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. **This is an educational toy code with simplified implementations intended for learning purposes only.**

## Overview

CGflow_IncompVOF_SurfaceTension is a toy code for simulating two-phase flows with surface tension effects. Developed primarily for educational purposes, this simplified solver demonstrates the interaction between immiscible fluids (such as air and water) in a 2D domain. The code implements a staggered grid arrangement with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method for interface tracking and includes surface tension modeling through the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) approach.

**Note:** As a toy code, this solver is intended for academic learning and simple demonstrations rather than production-level CFD simulations. It contains simplifications that make it accessible for educational purposes but may limit its accuracy for complex real-world problems.

## Limitations

As this is a toy code developed for educational purposes, it has several important limitations:

- Limited to 2D simulations only
- Fixed rectangular domain with simple boundary conditions (no complex geometries)
- No turbulence modeling capabilities
- Limited numerical stability for high Reynolds number flows
- Basic VOF implementation without geometric reconstruction methods
- Simplified CSF implementation for surface tension
- No adaptive time stepping or grid refinement capabilities
- No parallelization for large-scale simulations
- Limited validation against analytical solutions or experimental data
- Simplified numerical methods that prioritize readability over performance
- Not optimized for computational efficiency
- Lacks robust error handling for edge cases
- Not recommended for production or research-grade simulations requiring high accuracy
